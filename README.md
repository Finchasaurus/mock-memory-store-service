<h1>MockMemoryStoreService</h1>
<h3>Emulation of Roblox's <b>MemoryStoreService</b> for offline development and testing</h3>

This is a set of modules, similar to [MockDataStoreService](https://github.com/buildthomas/MockDataStoreService) by buildthomas. This emulates the memory store service rather than using the actual service. This allows for testing it in offline places/local place files with code or frameworks that require the use of MemoryStoreService.

## Installation
```
npm i @rbxts/mock-memory-store-service
```
